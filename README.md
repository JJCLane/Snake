Snake
=====

Demo available: [http://projects.jordanlane.me/snake/](http://projects.jordanlane.me/snake/)

My take on the tutorial found here [The code player](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery)

The focus was to practice OOP principles and try and avoid using jQuery.
